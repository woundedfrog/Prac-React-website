react notes:


          <Route path='/playlist' element={<XS/>} /> 
the /playlist refers to the file name in the pages folder
the element= refers to the variable in the import VARNAME from.  the from is the direct location of the js file

  <li className='nav-item'>
              <Link
                to='/2'
                className='nav-links'
                onClick={closeMobileMenu}
              >
                YouTubePl
              </Link>

the "to=" in the navbar links needs to be the same address as Route "path=/2" in the App.js
